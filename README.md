# List of my codes in Machine Learning

my codes Machine Learning

## 1/ Statistics pandas

test.py use a set of data wich is bit useless, so to get a correct example i made an other with bitcoin (cf bitcoin.py)

## 2/ Linear Regression

regression_lineaire.py is a test i made to understand what i needed to do

## 3/ Logistic Regression

mnist.py is a test i made to understand what the point
classifieur.py is my first code i attempt to made. It gave me strange results so i restarted
logistik.py is my final code, using logistic regression librairy

## 4/ Infinitesimal calculs

calcul.py is a simple calcul code that find a value at a precision rounded reducting the variance
taylor.py is a application of the taylor formula (with MacLaurin simplification) that give the log expression and the infinitesimal calcul

## 5/ Recommendation

movielens.py use an example of frequency words calcul with SVD algorithm and movielens librairy
tf_idp.py show differents words and words frequency in a text

## 6/ Random Forest

It's a new ML Calcul allowing to get scatter of points in a area and differenciate it
